<p>Baked beans can make up part of a balanced diet, but it’s best to eat them alongside foods such as vegetables, eggs and slow-release carbohydrates to ensure a good balance of nutrients with not too much salt or sugar. Where possible, choose the lower salt variety or make your own.<br><br>  If you are buying canned baked beans, it’s worth keeping an eye on the salt and sugar content. On average, half a can of shop-bought baked beans can contain around 9g of sugar.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baked_beans">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Pot Noodle is a brand of instant noodle snack foods, available in a selection of flavours and varieties. This dehydrated food consists of wide noodles, assorted dried vegetables and flavouring powder. It is prepared by adding boiling water, which after two to three minutes softens the noodles and dissolves the powdered sauce.<br><br>

  The product is packaged in a plastic pot, from which the prepared noodles can be eaten. Many pots contain a sachet of sauce, such as soy sauce.

        <p>Fish and chips is a popular hot dish consisting of fried fish in crispy batter, served with chips (French fries or wedges). The dish originated in England, where these two components had been introduced from separate immigrant cultures; it is not known who created the culinary fusion that became the emblematic British meal.  <br><br>
          Often considered Britain's national dish, fish and chips is a common take-away food in the United Kingdom and particularly English-speaking and Commonwealth nations.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_and_chips">Wikipedia</a></p>
