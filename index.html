        <strong>Pot Noodle</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        "Pot Noodle is a brand of instant noodle snack foods, available in a
        selection of flavours and varieties. This dehydrated food consists of
        wide noodles, assorted dried vegetables and flavouring powder. It is
        prepared by adding boiling water, which after two to three minutes
        softens the noodles and dissolves the powdered sauce. The product is
        packaged in a plastic pot, from which the prepared noodles can be eaten.
        Many pots contain a sachet of sauce, such as soy sauce."

      <strong>Fish and Chips</strong>

      <p>
        "Fish and chips is a popular hot dish consisting of fried fish in crispy
        batter, served with chips (French fries or wedges). The dish originated
        in England, where these two components had been introduced from separate
        immigrant cultures; it is not known who created the culinary fusion that
        became the emblematic British meal. Often considered Britain's national
        dish, fish and chips is a common take-away food in the United
        Kingdom."<br />
