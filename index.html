        <strong>Beans on Toast</strong>
        <br />
        <br />

        "Baked beans is a dish traditionally containing white beans that are
        parboiled and then, in the US, baked in sauce at low temperature for a
        lengthy period. In the United Kingdom, the dish is sometimes baked, but
        usually stewed in sauce. Canned baked beans are not baked, but are
        cooked through a steam process."

      <strong>Pot Noodle</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      "Pot Noodle is a brand of instant noodle snack foods, available in a
      selection of flavours and varieties. This dehydrated food consists of wide
      noodles, assorted dried vegetables and flavouring powder. It is prepared
      by adding boiling water, which after two to three minutes softens the
      noodles and dissolves the powdered sauce. The product is packaged in a
      plastic pot, from which the prepared noodles can be eaten. Many pots
      contain a sachet of sauce, such as soy sauce."

      <strong>Fish and Chips</strong>

      <p>
        "Fish and chips is a popular hot dish consisting of fried fish in crispy
        batter, served with chips (French fries or wedges). The dish originated
        in England, where these two components had been introduced from separate
        immigrant cultures; it is not known who created the culinary fusion that
        became the emblematic British meal. Often considered Britain's national
        dish, fish and chips is a common take-away food in the United
        Kingdom."<br />
